# material_design

This project contains a few custom material design widgets and example layouts.
It serves as the basis for a php based web-engine that uses modules to create 
its pages.

Keep this project completely seperate to the engine.

Tested using Xampp v3.2.2 on Windows 7 Professional on an Apache 2.4.18 width Php 7.0.8.
